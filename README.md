üß¨ codebiogenomics: I work at Instytut Chemii Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk, Pozna≈Ñ Poland as area expert a part of a very good team and responsible for genomic analysis and software development for illumina and long read sequencing approaches. I work using Python, R, RUST and I provide bio-software development, algorithms, bioinformatics, machine learning as an Area Expert area for Illumina and LongRead sequencing technologies across all domains of life covering plant, bacterial, fungal and humans. What i do and what i have done is outlaid below, so that you can have a broader ideea of what you are looking into and what i extend. I work across all species.

Scientific and Bio-Computing Areas of Interest: 
üß¨ I am specific to the genomics area such as RNA-seq, single cell genomics, and any genomics or protein language models and biological machine and deep learning üß¨ and bio-software. 

üß¨ Sequencing specifics: \
2010-2021: Plant, Bacterial, Fungi üß¨ RNASeq, GenomSeq, Phylogenomics, PacBio Sequencing, Single Cell Analysis, Bio-software. \
2021:2023: Machine Learning, Bio-software. üß¨ \
2024: PanGenome, Bio-software.üß¨ \
2025: Human Genomicsüß¨and Bio-software,Mobile Bio-software üß¨,Blockchain Healthcare üß¨

üß¨ Language stack: I am very specific and oritented toward taking typed languages over the others. I have categorized every language for specific purposes, so that i can use the maximum use of the same. Such as, I dont do web programming in Python such as Django and other web frameworks in Python. I only use Python for deep and machine learning purposes. This distinction allows me to use the maximum benefit of what language has to offer and in-demand according to the latest development in those respective languages. I am not in favour of learning many languages but in favour of keeping a well grounded productive stack for my work. Hence, what i do, you will find below and this is what i code in recently and will code in future and my complete attention goes to this productive stack only. My language stack has been dominated by the typed languages and you can find below: 

Software Development:C++(2010-2021) and now I use RUST. \
Web/Mobile Development: RUST, React/React Native/Expo. \
Bioinformatics/Data Analysis/Machine and Deep Learning: Python \
Blockchain Healthcare: RUST \
‚ùå What i don't code anymore: C++ since 2021 (2010-2021), dropped DevOPS and Golang (2024).

üß¨ Research and Topics and areas, I follow on X (previously Twitter).You will find the same on my GitHub account: 
1. Bioinformatics and Computational Biology including data science üß¨. 
2. Software engineers and programming languages and tooling associated with the same,
3. Genomics üß¨ algorithms 
4. Machine and deep learning 
5. Desktop and Mobile application development.

üß¨ Research and Topics and areas, I dont work, read and explore: DevOPS, IOT and System Design and Management.
