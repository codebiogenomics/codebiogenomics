🧬 codebiogenomics: I work at Instytut Chemii Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk, Poznań Poland as a part of a very good team. I work as area expert and responsible for genomic analysis and software development for illumina and long read sequencing approaches. I work using Python, R, RUST, Elixir, Typescript and I provide bio-software development, algorithms, bioinformatics, machine learning as an Area Expert area for Illumina and LongRead sequencing technologies across all domains of life covering plant, bacterial, fungal and humans.

Scientific and Bio-Computing Areas of Interest: 
🧬 I am specific to the genomics area such as RNA-seq, single cell genomics, and any genomics or protein language models and biological deep bio ML 🧬 and bio-software. 
❌ I don't do protein structural modelling, and ML on the same.

🧬 Sequencing specifics: \
2010-2021: Plant, Bacterial, Fungi 🧬 RNASeq, GenomSeq, Phylogenomics, PacBio Sequencing, Single Cell Analysis, Bio-software. 👨‍💻 \
2021:2023: Machine Learning, Bio-software. 🧬 \
2024: PanGenome, Bio-software.🧬 \
2025: Human Genomics 🧬and Bio-software, Mobile Bio-software 🧬 , Blockchain Healthcare 🧬

🧬 Language stack: I am very specific and oritented toward taking typed languages over the others. I am not in favour of learning many languages but in favour of keeping a well grounded productive stack. My language stack has been dominated by the typed languages and you can find below: \
Software Development: C++ (2010-2021) and now I use RUST. \
Web and Mobile Development: RUST, Typescript, React and React Native and Expo. \
Bioinformatics Data Analysis: Python, R. \
Blockchain Healthcare: RUST,Javascript, Python and Elixir. 
❌ What i don't code anymore: C++ since 2021 (2010-2021), dropped DevOPS and Golang (2024).

🧬 Language categorization: \
I have categorized every language for specific purposes, so that i can use the maximum use of the same. Such as, I dont do web programming in Python such as Django and other web frameworks in Python. Similarly in R, i dont do Shiny and hence only used Python and R for deep learning and machine learning purposes. This distincttion allows me to use the maximum benefit of what language has to offer and in-demand according to the latest development in those respective languages.
